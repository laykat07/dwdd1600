        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>At <strong>BetterSki</strong>, we are dedicated to bridging the gap between basic proficiency and
            <em>mountain mastery</em>. We believe that skiing is a lifelong pursuit of refinement, and our platform
            serves as the definitive resource for athletes committed to technical progression. By synthesizing expert
            coaching insights with data-driven gear analysis and resort intelligence, we provide a structured roadmap
            for skiers at every stage of their journey. Our mission is to empower the community with high-level
            technical breakdowns, from mastering edge angles, ensuring that every turn is executed with confidence and
            precision. Whether you are transitioning to your first intermediate run or seeking the most demanding
            vertical drops in the world, BetterSki is your partner in unlocking the full potential of the alpine
            environment.
        </p>
        <p>Our commitment extends <strong>beyond</strong> mere instruction to the cultivation of a comprehensive
            mountain lifestyle. We understand that true confidence is built through a combination of physical
            conditioning, mental readiness, and an intimate understanding of the elements. By providing in-depth
            analysis of snow science, mountain safety, and advanced navigation strategies, BetterSki ensures that you
            are prepared for the complexities of high-altitude environments. We strive to foster a global community of
            passionate skiers who value discipline, respect for the terrain, and the relentless pursuit of excellence.
            Join us as we redefine what is possible on the slopes, turning every descent into a showcase of skill and
            every season into a milestone of personal achievement.</p>
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>BetterSki was born from a shared realization on a cold morning in the backcountry: the traditional
            "intermediate plateau" isn't a lack of talent—it's a lack of accessible, high-level information. Our
            founders, a team of former racers and certified instructors, spent years watching passionate skiers stall in
            their progression because they didn't have access to the same asynchronous coaching technology and
            data-driven analysis used by professionals. We started with a simple mission to deconstruct complex
            technical maneuvers into actionable drills that any committed athlete could master. What began as a series
            of local technical clinics has since evolved into a global platform, dedicated to providing the
            instructional roadmap necessary to turn every mountain visit into a breakthrough session. Today, we continue
            to push the boundaries of alpine education, ensuring that the path to mountain mastery is open to anyone
            willing to put in the work.</p>

        <h2>Best Locations</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt><strong>Utah</strong></dt>
            <dd>Utah is a <em>premier</em> skiing destination largely due to its scientifically unique "Greatest Snow on Earth," a trademarked claim backed by a phenomenon known as the "Goldilocks Effect." This occurs when storms are "just right," delivering a high frequency of "right-side up" snowfall where heavier snow falls first to smooth the terrain, followed by a lighter, low-density layer on top that creates an exhilarating feeling of weightless "flotation." Beyond the legendary powder, the state offers unmatched accessibility, with 10 world-class resorts located within an hour's drive of Salt Lake City International Airport. This proximity allows visitors to land in the morning and be on the slopes by the afternoon. Whether you are exploring the expansive 7,300 acres of Park City Mountain—the largest resort in the U.S.—or the steep, skier-only chutes of Alta, Utah's diverse terrain and consistent 500-inch annual average snowfall make it a global "mecca" for winter sports. </dd>
            <dt><strong>Colorado</strong></dt>
            <dd>Colorado is <em>widely</em> considered the #1 skiing destination in North America because of its unmatched scale and high-altitude advantages. Home to 28 ski areas, the state boasts many of the largest resorts in the country, including Vail's massive 5,317-acre footprint and the four interconnected mountains of Aspen Snowmass. What truly sets Colorado apart is its extreme elevation, with some resorts reaching altitudes near 14,000 feet, ensuring one of the longest ski seasons in the world—often stretching from October through June. This height also preserves the state's signature "Champagne Powder," a light, dry snow that stays fluffy due to low moisture levels and cold mountain air. Beyond the slopes, Colorado's vibrant ski culture is defined by world-class après-ski scenes in historic mountain towns and unique amenities like the Winter Park Express train, which allows visitors to travel directly from downtown Denver to the base of the mountain.</dd>
